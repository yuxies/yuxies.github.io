I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Lehigh University's Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering (ISE). I earned my B.S. in Management Science and Applied Mathematics from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. 

My current research focues mixed integer bilevel linear programming (MIBLP) algorithm and software development, and I work under the supervision of Professor [Ted Ralphs](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/~ted/).

I am also a member of [Lehigh University Choral Arts](https://choralarts.lehigh.edu/). Every year, we have our Fall concert in October, Christmas Versper's in December, and Spring concerts in March and May. 

Fun fact: I am learning Spanish (for Flamenco dance and music), Japanese (to pick up where I left off in High School), Latin (to understand choir pieces), Arabic (alphabet, art, and music), and Russian (since a friend is also learning it because she married a Russian) on Duolingo and Thai (a friend's native language) on Drops.
