I am a third-year Ph.D. student at Lehigh University's Department of Industrial and Systems Engineering ([Lehigh ISE](https://engineering.lehigh.edu/ise)). I earned my B.S. in Management Science and Applied Mathematics from Southern Methodist University in Dallas, TX. 

My research focuses on mixed-integer bilevel linear programming (MIBLP) algorithms and software development, and I work under the supervision of Professor [Ted Ralphs](https://coral.ise.lehigh.edu/~ted/).

I am also a member of [Lehigh University Choral Arts](https://choralarts.lehigh.edu/). Every year, we have our Fall concert in October, Christmas Versper's in December, and Spring concerts in March and May. 

I am learning Spanish (for Flamenco dance and music), Japanese (to pick up where I left off in high school), Latin (to understand choir pieces), Arabic (for its alphabet and culture), and Russian (a friend is also learning it) on Duolingo and Thai (a friend's native language) on Drops.
